Building a comprehensive social media platform for researchers involves creating several interconnected components. Here's a list of key functionalities and the corresponding websites/modules you might need to build:

1. **Main Website/Platform:**
   - This is the core of your social media platform where users can sign up, log in, and access various features.

2. **User Profiles:**
   - Users should be able to create and customize their profiles, adding information about their research interests, expertise, and more.

3. **News Feed/Posts:**
   - Implement a feed where researchers can post updates about their research, share articles, and engage with other users' content.

4. **Collaboration Hub:**
   - Provide a space for researchers to find collaborators based on similar research interests or expertise.

5. **Funding Section:**
   - Create a dedicated section where researchers can post funding requests or proposals, and others can contribute or provide funding.

6. **Chat/Messaging System:**
   - Build a messaging system to enable private and group chats, fostering direct communication between researchers.

7. **Research Paper Repository:**
   - Develop a platform for researchers to upload, share, and download research papers. Ensure proper categorization and search functionality.

8. **Forums/Discussion Boards:**
   - Implement discussion forums where researchers can engage in topic-specific discussions and seek advice.

9. **Help/Support Desk:**
   - Set up a support system where researchers can seek help, ask questions, or report issues.

10. **Notifications System:**
    - Design a notification system to alert users about new messages, collaboration opportunities, and relevant updates.

11. **Search Functionality:**
    - Implement a robust search feature allowing users to find other researchers, posts, papers, or funding opportunities.

12. **Security and Privacy Features:**
    - Ensure that the platform has secure user authentication, data encryption, and privacy settings for user profiles and posts.

13. **Mobile Application:**
    - Consider developing a mobile app for researchers who prefer to access the platform on their smartphones.

14. **Analytics Dashboard:**
    - Include an analytics dashboard for users to track the performance of their posts, engagement metrics, and collaboration history.

15. **Content Moderation System:**
    - Implement a moderation system to ensure that the content posted aligns with community guidelines and standards.

16. **User Feedback System:**
    - Set up a system for users to provide feedback, report issues, and suggest improvements.

17. **Admin Panel:**
    - Create an admin panel for managing user accounts, monitoring activity, and addressing any platform-wide issues.

Remember to prioritize a user-friendly interface, seamless navigation, and a responsive design for both desktop and mobile users. Building such a complex platform may require collaboration with a team of developers, designers, and possibly legal advisors to address privacy and regulatory considerations.
